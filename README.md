## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational
pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health
if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit
points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Problem Creater's Organization

## Idea
DIY E-Waste Upcycling Projects: Promote DIY upcycling projects where old electronic components are
repurposed into new and creative items. This can include artwork, furniture, or fashion accessories made from
recycled circuit boards, wires, and other electronic parts.
